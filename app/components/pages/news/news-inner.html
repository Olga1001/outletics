                            We are delighted with the fantastic media coverage that we received for the opening of our first park in Vevey.
                            <br> Here's the article from 24 heures. You can read the full article by Karim Di Matteo on this link

                            Vevey is making its outdoor fitness park a permanent feature <br> After a trial period in spring, ten machines are now available to use around the clock by the Veveyse river mouth.
                            <br>
                            Others are to appear elsewhere. <br> This Friday's opening of ten fitness appliances at the end of Quai Maria-Belgia by the Veveyse river mouth saw Vevey Council approve last spring's trial period. At the end of the 2-month trial period between March and May, users of the four temporary machines in the Jardin du Rivage were overwhelmingly positive about it becoming a permanent feature. They could give there opinion through an electronic ballot. Result: 80% of the 7500 votes were positive.

                            Air walker, cross trainer, pull-up bars, horizontal bars, back massage and waist twister: the variety of the range means there's something for everyone who wants to keep fit with an idyllic view of the lake to boot. Each machine comes with a user guide.
                            <br> These installations also provide a solution to the then President of the Council Vladimir Angelo's suggestion that these sorts of sites should be created back in early 2016. A quarter of the cost of the ten machines - 50,000 Francs - is covered by the Canton.

                            The Vevey Sports Councillor Lionel Girardin believes there should be far more of these facilities: "One spot clearly isn't enough." We could expect to see between five and seven in the future near playgrounds and to promote parks and gardens. There could even be trails of varying lengths to get people to revisit their hometown whilst exercising on their own or with the family."
